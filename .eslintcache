The\n            arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial\n            Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\")\n            and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for\n            Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which are\n            available at the AAA website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and\n            your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA\n            Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer\n            Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be\n            excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The\n            arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of\n            documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision\n            in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless\n            requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable\n            law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do\n            so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or\n            applicable law, the arbitration will take place in New York, New\n            York. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate\n            in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending\n            arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the\n            award entered by the arbitrator.\n            <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than\n            arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in\n            thestate and federal courts located in New York, New York, and the\n            Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of\n            personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to\n            venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
