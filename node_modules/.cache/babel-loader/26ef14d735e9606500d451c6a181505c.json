The arbitrator will make a decision\n            in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless\n            requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable\n            law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do\n            so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or\n            applicable law, the arbitration will take place in New York, New\n            York.
