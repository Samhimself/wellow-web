YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD\n            HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration\n            shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration\n            Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where\n            appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related\n            Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which are available at the\n            AAA website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of\n            arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules\n            and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such\n            costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay\n            all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in\n            person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The\n            arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a\n            statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator\n            must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the\n            arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the\n            applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take\n            place in New York, New York. Except as otherwise provided herein, the\n            Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings\n            pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment\n            on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n            <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than\n            arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in thestate\n            and federal courts located in New York, New York, and the Parties\n            hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal\n            jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and\n            jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
