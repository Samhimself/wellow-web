Nothing in these Terms of\n        Use will be construed to obligate us to maintain and support the Site or\n        to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.\n        GOVERNING LAW These Terms of Use and your use of the Site are governed\n        by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New\n        York applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed\n        within the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law\n        principles. DISPUTE RESOLUTION To expedite resolution and control the\n        cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use\n        (each a \"Dispute\" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either\n        you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the\n        Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those\n        Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty\n        (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations\n        commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party. Binding\n        Arbitration If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through\n        informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly\n        excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding\n        arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE\n        THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall\n        be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the\n        American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the\n        AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA\n        Consumer Rules\"), both of which are available at the AAA\n        website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator\n        compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where\n        appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are\n        determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all\n        arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in\n        person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The\n        arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a\n        statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator\n        must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the\n        arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the\n        applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place\n        in New York, New York. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties\n        may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending\n        arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the\n        award entered by the arbitrator.       If for any reason, a Dispute\n        proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be\n        commenced or prosecuted in thestate and federal courts located in New\n        York, New York, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all\n        defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with\n        respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.\n        Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n        International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information\n        Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use. In no event\n        shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site\n        be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If\n        this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither\n        Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of\n        this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute\n        shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts\n        listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the\n        personal jurisdiction of that court. Restrictions The Parties agree that\n        any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties\n        individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration\n        shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or\n        authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to\n        utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority\n        for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on\n        behalf of the general public or any other persons. Exceptions to\n        Informal Negotiations and Arbitration The Parties agree that the\n        following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning\n        informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking\n        to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the\n        intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or\n        arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or\n        unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this\n        provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party\n        will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this\n        provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be\n        decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed\n        for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal\n        jurisdiction of that court. CORRECTIONS There may be information on the\n        Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions,\n        including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other\n        information.
